# DnD_Group_Finder
A "Dating App" for dungeons and dragons players to find groups.

The idea behind this project is to make a mobile application that is designed to find people around you who want to play or host games of dungeons and dragons, and to let you connect with these people. The idea can be extended to more tabletop role playing games so that any claims or copyright might be avoided from wizards of the coast. Additionally it can be extended to people looking to play boardgames or to organize and message/coordinate with a regular gaming group.

This app is designed to bring people together and should make meeting up with friends and playing games easier and more fun.
